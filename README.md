# Synacor Virtual Machine

This is my implementation of a bytecode virual machine for the
[Synacor Challenge][synacor-challenge].

This particular implementation is written in [Rust][rust-lang], though I am also
considering writing an implementation in [Haskell][haskell] sometime. I'd love
to hear feedback on it, so feel free to email me if you'd like (you can find my
PGP key on MIT or other keyservers if you prefer private communications).
